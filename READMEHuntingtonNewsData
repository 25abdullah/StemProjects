Data Journalism & Visualization Portfolio 
Documentation and records of my work with the Huntington News. As a data editor, I Clean, analyze, and visualize public datasets using Python pandas and matplotlib, then transform findings into interactive graphics via Flourish and Datawrapper. 
I create data-driven illustrations for articles by writers, making complex trends accessible through maps, charts, and visual narratives.
