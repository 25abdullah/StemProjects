Data Journalism & Visualization Portfolio
Comprehensive data analysis and visualization projects examining public safety and housing trends in Boston using Python, Flourish, and Datawrapper.

Project 1: Boston Shooting Data Analysis (2015-2024)
Overview
In-depth analysis of Boston shooting data from 2015-2024, identifying trends in fatal and non-fatal incidents across the city. This project uses Python for data manipulation, statistical analysis, and visualization to uncover meaningful patterns in public safety data for The Huntington News.
Key Findings

47% reduction in total shootings from 2015 to 2024 (245 → 129 incidents)
2,141 total shooting incidents over the 10-year period
15.65% fatal rate (355 fatal, 1,786 non-fatal shootings)
COVID-era spike: Notable increase in shootings during 2020, peaking at 276 total incidents
Consistent decline from 2020 peak through 2024

Technical Implementation

Data Processing: Used pandas for filtering, boolean indexing, and temporal analysis
Visualizations: Created matplotlib bar charts showing trends over time
Statistical Analysis: Calculated percent change, fatality rates, and year-over-year comparisons
Data Export: Generated CSV files for further analysis (Fatal_Shootings_Over_Time.csv, Non_Fatal_Shootings_Over_Time.csv, Total_Shootings_Over_Time.csv)

Technologies Used

Python, pandas, matplotlib
Jupyter Notebook (Google Colab)
Boolean indexing for data filtering
datetime manipulation for temporal analysis

Visualizations Created
Three comprehensive charts tracking:

Fatal shootings by year - Showing decline from 48 (2018) to 20 (2024)
Non-fatal shootings by year - Peak of 228 in 2020, declining to 109 in 2024
Total shootings over time - Overall downward trend with COVID spike

Future Analysis Opportunities

District-level analysis of shooting concentrations
Demographic patterns in victim data
Seasonal/monthly trends within years
Multi-victim incident analysis


Project 2: Greater Boston Housing Vacancy Rate Analysis
Overview
Interactive data visualizations analyzing the increase in housing vacancy rates across Greater Boston neighborhoods since 2024. This dual-platform project examines Real-Time Vacancy Rate (RTVR) changes, combining quantitative comparison with geographic distribution for comprehensive storytelling.
Key Findings

Symphony showed the largest vacancy rate increase (~183%)
Fort Hill experienced the second-largest increase (~85%)
Mission Hill and Roxbury showed moderate increases
Fenway had minimal change (~3%)
Allston was omitted due to a negative vacancy rate change
Neighborhoods in central Boston saw more dramatic shifts than outer areas

Datawrapper Visualization
Interactive Map: "See where housing vacancy rates around Greater Boston have increased since 2024"

Geographic bubble map showing spatial distribution of vacancy rate changes
Proportional circle sizing based on RTVR increase magnitude
Color gradient scale: teal (3%) to dark blue (183%)
Labeled neighborhoods: Symphony, Fort Hill, Roxbury, Mission Hill, Fenway, South End, Back Bay
Greater Boston metropolitan area with neighborhood boundary overlays
Gray base map providing geographic context

Interactive Features:

Geographic positioning shows actual neighborhood locations
Visual clustering around central Boston neighborhoods
Spatial patterns reveal downtown concentration of increases

Data Sources

Primary Source: Boston Pads rental data platform
Metric: Real-Time Vacancy Rate (RTVR) and Real-Time Availability Rate (RTAR)
Time Period: 2024 baseline comparison
Geographic Scope: Greater Boston neighborhoods

Technologies Used
Flourish:

Interactive bar chart creation
Annotation and sourcing capabilities
Responsive chart design
Clean, editorial-style formatting

Datawrapper:

Interactive geographic/bubble map visualization
Custom color scales and proportional sizing
Neighborhood boundary integration
Geographic data mapping tools

Design Decisions

Dual visualization strategy: Bar chart for direct comparison, map for geographic context
Bubble size: Proportional to magnitude of change for immediate visual impact
Color gradient (map): Teal-to-dark-blue scale showing progression of increases
Consistent red (chart): Creates strong visual identity for the data story
Typography: Clear, accessible fonts optimized for both print and digital
Data integrity: Transparent about omitting Allston with clear explanation

Visualization Strategy
The combination of Flourish (comparison) and Datawrapper (geography) provides:

Quick understanding: Bar chart shows "what" and "how much"
Spatial context: Map reveals "where" and geographic patterns
Complementary insights: Readers can see both rank order and proximity
Enhanced storytelling: Two angles on the same housing trend
