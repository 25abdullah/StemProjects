# StemProjects
This readme outlines the Autodesk Inventor (CAD) and Python Projects that I have complied. Starting with the Python Projects:

1.) NumberGuess- A game where you have to guess a number from 1-50 in three attempts 

2.) Tower- Using turtle graphics, this program creates two towers with alternating colors based on the user's color inputs.

3.) Meanof3Numbers- Computes the mean of three numbers. 

4.) randomPassword- creates a random password along with a random Gmail username

5.) RockPaperScissors- a rock-paper-scissors game against the computer that also incorporates turtle graphics to depict the chosen move.

6.) Stickfigure- uses functions to create a stick figure. 

7.) wordcounter- computes the number of words given a text. Additionally, it gives feedback on if the user has exceeded their minimum and
maximum word count based on their input.

CAD Projects:

1.) Truck- Based on the Freightliner FL86 cab which was a flat-nose truck.  

2.) B2bomber- Based on the B2 stealth bomber, a United States military plane.

3.) Chair- A model of a simple chair, my first Inventor Project.

4.) F1- Based on the 90s era Ferrari F1 cars. 

5.) Mustang- Based on a 2007 Ford Mustang GT, convertible edition. 

6.) Pencil holder- Based on a pencil holder to hold stationary utensils. 

7.) Sr71- Based on a United States reconnaissance plane, the Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird.
